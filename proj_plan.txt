1) Password encryption
2) Create user page.
3) TLS (https)
4) Create database schema.
 - win/loss stats table (foreign key to user_id)
 - record game moves (database or files, idk)


Questions:
1) Can the application be hosted externally (heroku / aws), or do we need to use a host computer?
2) "Player cannot make any game pause forever" -- Do we account for users that just get leave the application running with no moves, or does this only apply to crashes/disconnects?
